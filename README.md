## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to apply theoretical machine learning knowledge to solve real-world problems using a structured pipeline. Our team focuses on the following objectives: 

- Implement a Traditional Text ML Pipeline: Develop a structured workflow including specialized Text EDA, preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal), feature extraction, and supervised learning.  

- Advanced Text Preprocessing: Execute rigorous cleaning of academic text, including handling scientific notations, lemmatization, and padding to ensure data quality.  

- Feature Extraction: Compare different vectorization techniques to transform text into numerical data:

+ Traditional Methods: Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.  

+ Modern Embeddings: Utilizing pre-trained models (SciBERT) and saving them as .npy files for downstream tasks.  

+ Model Optimization: Evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms to find the most accurate model for classification.  

+ Exploratory Data Analysis (Text-focused): Conduct in-depth EDA to analyze word frequency distributions, document length statistics, and label balance within the article dataset.  

+ Reproducible Research: Deliver a fully functional Google Colab notebook that executes the entire pipeline seamlessly and provides a comparative analysis of the results.
